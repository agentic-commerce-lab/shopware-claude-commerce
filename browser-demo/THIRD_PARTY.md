## GPL notice

`lite4mariadb` and `@php-wasm/*` are GPL-licensed. They are delivered as separate WebAssembly and
JavaScript files that the browser loads at runtime; the demo shell, the Shopware plugins and the
agents in this repository are not derived from them and keep their own licenses (MIT / Apache-2.0).
When you redistribute `dist/site/`, keep these components' license texts available
(`playground/node_modules/lite4mariadb/LICENSE`; the `@php-wasm/*` packages carry the license in
their `package.json` and the WordPress Playground repository) and point to their source repositories
as done above.

## Patched components

`patches/` holds every change made to third-party code (see `patches/README.md`). The patches are
applied to the fetched copies during `npm run build`; the upstream repositories are not modified.
