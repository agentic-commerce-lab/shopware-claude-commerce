# Merchant agent

FastAPI host implementing the blueprint `MerchantBackend` on top of **Shopware Admin
MCP** (`POST /api/_mcp`, the `shopware-entity-*` tools), with Admin REST as a fallback
transport. Every change is staged, previewed by the server's dry run and applied only
through `POST /api/merchant/changes/{id}/apply`.

## Run

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn merchant.api.main:app --port 8005
```

The host needs the integration credentials below (`docker/bootstrap.sh` writes them to
`docker/.generated.env`). `SHOPWARE_LOCAL_STORE=1` runs on `FakeAdmin` with
`data/seed.json` instead — no Shopware, no live writes. Health still starts when
credentials are missing and says what to set.

Chat needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; identity-linked keys also need `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`
(`shopware_common/anthropic_client.py` adds the `anthropic-workspace-id` header).

### Environment

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHOPWARE_URL` / `SHOPWARE_ADMIN_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Shop base URL (`/api/_mcp`, `/api/...`) |
| `SHOPWARE_INTEGRATION_ACCESS_KEY` | — | Integration access key (OAuth `client_credentials`) |
| `SHOPWARE_INTEGRATION_SECRET_KEY` | — | Integration secret |
| `SHOPWARE_ADMIN_TRANSPORT` | `mcp` | `mcp` (server dry-run previews) or `rest` (no dry run) |
| `SHOPWARE_SALES_CHANNEL_ID` | resolved from `sales_channel` "Storefront" | Sales channel promotions are bound to |
| `SHOPWARE_LOCAL_STORE` | `0` | `1` → `FakeAdmin`, no live shop |
| `SHOPWARE_STORE_NAME` | sales channel name | Display name |
| `SHOPWARE_LOW_STOCK_DEFAULT` | `8` | Fallback when `data/thresholds.json` has no `default` |
| `MERCHANT_OPERATOR` | `Operator` | Actor recorded on staged/applied changes |
| `MERCHANT_REQUIRE_HOST_APPROVAL` | `1` | Blueprint gate: the model never applies |
| `MERCHANT_LEDGER_DSN` | `sqlite:///./merchant/data/ledger.db` | Ledger file; `:memory:` for tests |

The admin user's password grant is **not** accepted by the host (ADR-14). It is used
only by `scripts/smoke_live.py` / `scripts/mcp_tools.py --admin` to bootstrap a
temporary integration when none is configured.

## Architecture

**Transport.** `AdminTransport` is operation-oriented — `search`, `read`, `aggregate`,
`upsert(dry_run)`, `delete(dry_run)` — so the fake can dispatch on the operation with the
same semantics as the live tools. `McpTransport` wraps `shopware_common.mcp_client.McpClient`
(Streamable HTTP handshake, session, retries) and serialises criteria/aggregations/payloads
as JSON *strings* (the tools' input schema). It calls `ensure_tool(name)` once per tool
before first use. `RestTransport` speaks `POST /api/search/{kebab-entity}`, `PATCH
/api/{entity}/{id}` and `POST /api/_action/sync` (lists, promotions, rules). Every call —
reads included — lands in `transport.calls` (a 500-entry deque); `admin_client.writes()`
lists the persisted writes so tests can prove staging never writes.

**MCP tools the backend calls** (the integration's tool allowlist must be exactly this):

```
shopware-entity-search
shopware-entity-read
shopware-entity-aggregate
shopware-entity-upsert
shopware-entity-delete
shopware-entity-schema
```

`shopware-entity-schema` is discovered but not called by the backend today; it is listed
because `shopware-entity-aggregate` declares a dependency on it. The `merchant-*` tools of
`SwagMcpMerchantTools` are not used.

**ACL privileges the integration needs.** The tool gate checks `{entity}:read` for
search/read/aggregate, `{entity}:update` for upserts whose rows carry an `id` (all of ours),
`{entity}:create` for rows without one, and `{entity}:delete` for deletes; the DAL then
checks every nested row it writes (`AclWriteValidator`), so a promotion create needs the
nested entities too.

```
product:read, product:update, product_translation:update
promotion:create, promotion:read, promotion:update, promotion:delete
promotion_translation:create, promotion_translation:update
promotion_discount:create, promotion_discount:read, promotion_discount:update, promotion_discount:delete
promotion_sales_channel:create, promotion_sales_channel:read, promotion_sales_channel:delete
promotion_discount_rule:create, promotion_discount_rule:read, promotion_discount_rule:delete
rule:create, rule:read, rule:update, rule:delete
rule_condition:create, rule_condition:read, rule_condition:delete
order:read, order_line_item:read, order_transaction:read, order_delivery:read, order_customer:read
state_machine_state:read, tax:read, currency:read, sales_channel:read, category:read
```

(`product_translation:update` covers the translation row Shopware rewrites on every product
upsert; `customer:read` and `product_manufacturer:read` are not required by any call the
backend makes.)

**Reads.** The catalog is paged through `shopware-entity-search` (100 rows per page until
`_meta.total`) with `tax` and `categories` associations; a child whose `price` is null
inherits the family price. Performance figures come from `shopware-entity-aggregate`:
`count`/`sum` over `order` for the current and the previous period (cancelled orders
excluded), `histogram` with a nested `sum` for `query_metrics` (missing buckets are filled
with 0), `terms` over `order_line_item.productId` with a nested `sum(quantity)` for slow
movers. Traffic and conversion are `None` — Shopware has no traffic source. Order issues
come from three targeted `order` searches (open/in-progress, payment failed/cancelled/
reminded, non-empty `customerComment`) evaluated locally; the seed marker
`commerce-agents-seed` is never reported as a buyer message. Everything degrades to empties
and `None` with zero orders.

**Staging = server dry run.** Every `stage_*` builds the exact Shopware payload, runs
`upsert(dry_run=True)` — Shopware executes the write in a transaction and rolls it back —
and refuses the change with `ChangeNotApplicable("Shopware rejected the preview: …")` when
the server does. The payload is stored with the change in the ledger and `apply_change`
replays **that** payload with `dry_run=False`. `guardrail_notes` carries the verdict:

```
preview: server dry-run OK — would write product, product_translation (1 row each)
preview not server-validated (REST transport) — Shopware checks the payload on apply
applied: wrote product (product, product_translation (1 row each))
```

* **Price (H6):** only the EUR entry of `price[]` is replaced, `net = round(gross / (1 +
  taxRate/100), 2)` from the product's `tax.taxRate` (19 % only if unreadable, noted),
  `linked` stays true. A family whose children all inherit is priced on the parent; a family
  with per-variant prices is staged per variant (plus the parent for the still-inheriting
  children); a variant that inherited gets its own price, with a note.
* **Restock (M1):** the staged *delta* is applied to the stock read at apply time; a moved
  base is noted (`stock on … moved from 4 to 6 since staging; applied +5 … → 11`).
* **Pause/activate (M2):** a family expands to the parent and every child, one `ChangeItem`
  each, written as one list upsert.
* **Promotion (ADR-13):** one atomic `promotion` upsert with `salesChannels`, a `cart`
  `percentage` discount and the restricting `rule` nested under `discountRules` (Shopware
  writes rule, conditions, promotion, translation, sales channel, discount and mapping in
  one transaction; the dry run validates all of it). The rule is `cartLineItem` with the
  variant ids of the listed families, so the discount applies to the **whole cart** when a
  listed product is in it — per-line scoping is a Phase 3 refinement. `ChangeItem`s are one
  per listing (`price` before → discounted); the promotion facts (id, %, window, sales
  channel, rule id) are in `guardrail_notes` because the blueprint's promotion guardrail
  needs every item to be a grounded price move. Discarding is ledger-only.
* **Partial failure:** a multi-payload plan that fails midway deletes what it created
  (`promotion`, `rule`) and reports `written before the failure: …; rolled back: …`.
* **K1/H9:** `apply_change`/`discard_change` refuse anything not `STAGED` before any call;
  a write that comes back as a preview (or `success: false`) raises `ChangeNotApplicable(
  "… It is still staged.")`. Campaigns are `ChangeNotApplicable`.

**Ledger (M7).** `SqliteChangeLedger` persists every transition and the write payloads;
on start it reloads them and continues the `chg-000N` sequence.

## Routes

The blueprint router (`vendor/demo_common/merchant.py`) is mounted unchanged at
`/api/merchant`; `overview` carries `shop` extras:

```json
{"shop": {"name": "Storefront", "operator": "ops@example.com", "currency": "EUR", "transport": "mcp", "sales_channel": "<id>"}}
```

`merchant/api/portal.py` adds three session-scoped reads (same `X-Session-Id` header):

| Route | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/merchant/dashboard?period=last_7d` | `{"period": {"label": "Aug 28 – Sep 3", "against": "the prior week", "key": "last_7d"}, "kpis": {"sales": {"value", "unit": "EUR", "change_pct", "points": [{"date", "value"}]}, "orders": {"value", "unit": "count", "change_pct", "points"}, "conversion": {"value": null, "note"}, "average_order": {"value", "unit": "EUR", "change_pct", "points"}}, "digest": "Sales are up 1.7% on the week. 5 orders and 6 listings need you today."}` |
| `GET /api/merchant/orders?limit=20` | `{"orders": [{"order_id", "order_number", "status", "payment_status", "delivery_status", "placed_at", "total", "currency", "items", "customer", "issue"?}]}` — `issue` ∈ `payment_failed`, `delayed`, `buyer_message` |
| `GET /api/merchant/changes?status=staged` | `{"status": "staged", "changes": [StagedChange…]}`; `status` ∈ `staged`, `applied`, `discarded`, `all` |

## Verify

```bash
pytest -q merchant                      # netless: FakeAdmin + in-process MCP/REST fakes
ruff check merchant && ruff format --check merchant
python merchant/scripts/mcp_tools.py    # live tools/list for the integration
python merchant/scripts/smoke_live.py   # live read-only
python merchant/scripts/smoke_live.py --write            # reversible round trips over MCP
python merchant/scripts/smoke_live.py --write --transport rest
```

`--write` stages and applies a +0.50 price move on `CA-OIL` and reverts it, creates a 10 %
promotion on `CA-TSHIRT`, verifies promotion/discount/rule and deletes them, and restocks
`CA-TSHIRT-S` +1 and back; it exits non-zero on any mismatch and uses an in-memory ledger.
